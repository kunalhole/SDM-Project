## 1.DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
### The DRY principle stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself." It's a fundamental concept in software design and programming. The principle is centered on reducing the repetition of software patterns, replacing duplications with abstractions, and ensuring that every piece of knowledge or logic has a single, authoritative, unambiguous representation within a system


## 2.HOLLYWOOD
### The basic idea of the HOLLYWOOD is that the user or developer provides some customization (like overriding methods or implementing interfaces), and the framework itself decides when and how to call or use these customizations. It helps in inverting the control flow: instead of the developer deciding when to perform an action, the framework decides.


## 3.SOLID:

### S : Single Responsibility Principle :
### A class should have only one reason to change. This means a class should have only one job or responsibility.

### O : Open for extension, close for modification :
### Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This suggests that the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code.

### L : Likove's Substitution Principl :
### Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. This means that objects of a derived class should be able to replace an object of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program.

### I : Interface Segregation Principle :
### Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means that a class shouldn't be forced to implement interfaces it doesn't use. Instead of one fat interface, many small and specific interfaces are preferred.


### D : Dependency Inversion Principle :
### High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This principle inverts the typical design pattern of high-level modules depending on the implementation of low-level modules.
